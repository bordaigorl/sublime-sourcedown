# SourceDown plugin for Sublime Text

Convert your commented scripts into Markdown documents. Useful for blog/forum posts.

The comments get uncommented and the code gets fenced/indented.
Your comments are copied verbatim so if they contain valid Markdown it will be rendered correctly.

## Installation

 1. Install [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
 2. Install the plugin either:
 
     - with **Package Control**: see <https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/usage>, or
     - **manually**: by cloning this repository in your Sublime Text Package directory
